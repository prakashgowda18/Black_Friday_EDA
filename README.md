# Black Friday Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Black Friday sales data to extract meaningful insights and trends. It uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.

### Objective:
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior based on various features such as age, gender, occupation, and product categories.
- Gain insights into product trends and customer demographics.
- Provide a clear and visual summary of the dataset for decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from a Black Friday sales event. It contains the following columns:
- **User_ID**: Unique customer ID
- **Product_ID**: Unique product ID
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age group of the customer
- **Occupation**: Occupation code of the customer
- **City_Category**: Category of the city where the customer lives
- **Stay_In_Current_City_Years**: Number of years the customer has been living in the current city
- **Marital_Status**: Whether the customer is married (1) or not (0)
- **Product_Category_1**, **Product_Category_2**, **Product_Category_3**: Product categories purchased by the customer
- **Purchase**: The purchase amount

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` (for additional data preprocessing and modeling)
  - `Jupyter Notebook` (to view or edit the notebook)

## Project Structure

- `Black_Friday_Analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and code.
- `README.md`: Project description and setup instructions (this file).
  
## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handle missing values in product categories.
    - Encode categorical features (e.g., Gender, Age, City).
  
2. **Data Visualization**:
    - Explore data using visualizations for customer demographics, product sales, and spending trends.
  
3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Create new features to gain deeper insights into customer behavior.

4. **Modeling (if applicable)**:
    - Apply basic machine learning models to predict the purchase amount based on customer demographics and product features.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Black_Friday_Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Black_Friday_Analysis
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Black_Friday_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

5. Run all cells to execute the analysis.

## Results and Insights

- **Customer Demographics**: Analysis shows significant differences in purchasing behavior between genders, age groups, and occupations.
- **Popular Product Categories**: Certain product categories are highly popular among different age groups.
- **Spending Trends**: High spending is correlated with certain age and occupation categories.
